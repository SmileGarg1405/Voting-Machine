# Voting-Machine
It is a very basic project of voting machine build up in C language. In this project the person first have to choose some id from the options given. If your choice is not present in the option then you are asked to select again till you enter some valid ID. Then the program will tell you your name and ask you to select some party from the given options. Then if you select valid option then it will add vote in the respective party but if you choose it wrong then it will not allow you to vote. In the end there will be an exit option . If you select that then the party with the name and number of votes will be printed and the program will terminate. But if you would choose option other than exit then you can give another vote and it will add all the respective votes to the party till you terminate the program.
